# algorithms

A repo to put some small algorithmic implementations and code challenges that I played around with and enjoyed.

Like a souvenir box...
of a killer :p

 - Finding anagrams in a set of keywords
 - Knapsack (the naive way): Time complexity: O(2 ^ n), Space complexity: O(1).
 - Knapsack (the recursive way)
